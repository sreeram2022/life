I've tried multiple terminal file managers like ranger, lf and nnn. Recently, there's a new file manager called yazi which was written in Rust. The things I liked most about this are

* It has Built-in Support for Multiple Image Protocols which no other file manager had.
* Scrollable Preview (for videos, PDFs, archives, directories, code, etc.) which is great.
* Integration with ripgrep, fd, fzf, zoxide
* Vim-like input/select/which/notify component, auto-completion for cd paths
* Theme System, Mouse Support, Trash Bin, Custom Layouts
* Bulk Renaming, Visual Mode, File Chooser
* it even Provides real-time progress updates, task cancellation, and internal task priority assignment.
