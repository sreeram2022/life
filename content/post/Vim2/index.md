## My Vim Obsession

There was a phase where I spent more time tweaking my `.vimrc` than actually writing code! I tried every plugin under the sun, from fuzzy finders to rainbow parentheses. It was fun, but eventually I realized that too much customization can slow you down.

**Plugin I can't live without:**
Harpoon. It makes jumping between files so fast, I can't imagine coding without it now.

**Tip:**
Find a balance between customizing Vim and actually getting work done. Start simple, add what you need, and don't be afraid to remove plugins that don't spark joy!
