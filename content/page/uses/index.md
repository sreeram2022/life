### Editing

* **Pixelmator Pro** serves as my go-to tool for photo editing. I've tried gimp in the past but pixelmator is more intuitive. With so many robust features I can enhance, manipulate photos effortlessly.

* **DaVinci Resolve** is the powerhouse of video editing. It has professional-grade editing suite in the free tier and also provides set of tools for basic editing, colour correction and audio post-production.

* I rely on **LazyVim** for all my writing. While Vim does have a steep learning curve, it ultimately simplifies my workflow. However, when I need to use certain extensions that are exclusive to **VS Code**, I switch over, particularly for its drag-and-drop functionality. Even then, I have vim mode enabled.

### software & Applications

* I currently use **kitty** for my terminal. I used default mac terminal at first and had terrible experience. Then I shifted to Iterm2 which was okay but it couldn't render neovim's colourschemes properly. So, I've started using kitty. It’s very customizable and very fast. For my shell, I use myzsh script with a few plugins like syntax highlighting and auto-complete.

* I use **arc** as my default browser. It is the brave replacement for me. It emphasises on productivity by managing tabs and spaces efficiency. We can customize website features so that I can remove unnecessary parts and change the appearance however I want. occasionally I use **Tor** for secure and private browsing. It offers anonymity by routing internet traffic through a global network of relays. If I'm using any apple service I use safari and it has copy text from a video feature which is awesome. I like experimenting with state of the art browsers so I often change my default browser.
For browser extensions, I use uBlock Origin to block ads and trackers, Vimium for vim-like keybindings (only usable in firefox) and speedup for controlling speed of all the videos including streaming services.

* I use the terminal file manager **yazi**. It has built in support for previewing images and vim like keybindings. I've tried lf, ranger and nnn. But yazi is simple and more intutive to use.

* **Notion** is where I capture my thoughts, manage projects and occasionally todo lists.

* **HandBrake** converts videos into various formats while providing control over parameters like bitrate, resolution and enables me to compress videos without loosing quality. The compression rate and the quality we get from this is amazing.

### Hardware

* I use 13.3-inch **M1 MacBook Pro** , 8‑core CPU & GPU, 8GB RAM with 256GB SSD. It's basic configuration. It's great especially interms of battery life but whenever I run large deep learning models or video editing & encoding, it's going to have hardtime processing it. I didn't purchase any major accessories with it but I use **EooCoo Keyboard Cover** for keyboard protection and **Dyazo Laptop Stand** as laptop stand.
* I repurpose **lenovoG575** as my ubuntu server for storing files. It's safer option compare to any other backup service. 
* For mouse I use **Logitech Pebble** with **Sounce Mouse Pad**. I don't use mouse that often, but it's crucial whenever I'm playing chess or performing any editing task.
* I used to use **Logitech K230** keyboard and **Logitech M235** mouse when I was using 10th Gen i5 **Hp** laptop.

### This Website
* This site is built with **Hugo**, a static site generator that just outputs HTML and CSS instead of the bloated mess that is most of the modern web.
I've used "hugo-theme-stack" theme. You can refer to my github page for source files.
* I use **NameCheap** to purchase my domains. It offers great prices and customer support is friendly and also I hosted this site on **cloudflare**.-
