### Editing

* **Pixelmator Pro** serves as my go-to tool for photo editing. I've tried gimp in the past but pixelmator is more intuitive. With so many robust features I can enhance, manipulate photos effortlessly.

* **DaVinci Resolve** is the powerhouse of video editing. It has professional-grade editing suite in the free tier and also provides set of tools for basic editing, colour correction and audio post-production.

* I use **neovim** for all of my writing. vim has steep learning curve, but it makes things easier. Whenever I want to use few extensions that are only available in  **VS Code** I use it. Mostly I use it for the drag and drop feature.

### software & Applications

* I currently use **kitty** for my terminal. I used mac default terminal at first and had terrible experience. Then I shifted Iterm2 which was okay but it couldn't render neovim's colourschemes properly. So, I've started using kitty. Itâ€™s very customizable but still very fast. For my shell, I use myzsh script with a few plugins for niceties like syntax highlighting and auto-complete.

* I use **arc** as my default browser. It is the brave replacement for me. It emphasises on productivity by managing tabs and spaces efficiency. I occasionally use **Tor** for secure and private browsing. It offers anonymity by routing internet traffic through a global network of relays. 
For browser extensions, I use uBlock Origin to block ads and trackers, Vimium for vim-like keybindings and speedup for controlling speed of all the videos including streaming services.

* I use the terminal file manager **yazi**. It has built in support for previewing images and vim like keybindings. I've tried lf, ranger and nnn. But yazi is simple and more intutive to use.

* **Notion** is where I capture my thoughts, manage projects occasionally todo lists.

* **HandBrake** converts videos into various formats while providing control over parameters like bitrate, resolution and enables me to compress my videos without loosing quality. The compression rate and the quality we get from this is amazing.

### This Website
* This site is built with **Hugo**, a static site generator that just outputs HTML and CSS instead of the bloated mess that is most of the modern web.
I've used "hugo-theme-stack" theme. You can refer to my github page for source files.
* I use **NameCheap** to purchase my domains. Great prices and customer support make this one a no-brainer for me and also I hosted this site on **cloudflare**.
